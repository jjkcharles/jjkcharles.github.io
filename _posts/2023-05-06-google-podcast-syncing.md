I recently was on the hunt for alternatives to [Pocket Casts](https://pocketcasts.com/) for my podcast consumption. While Pocket Casts has proven to be an excellent service and I've pretty happy with their offering, things didn't go all that well when I started consuming podcasts through my laptop (earlier, I use to consume them only through mobile).

The primary concern I faced was, [Pocket Casts' Web player](https://play.pocketcasts.com/) is available only for Pocket Casts Plus subscribers. This also meant that I would have to manually sync my listening progress whenever I switched devices while in the middle of a podcast.

I decided to give [Google Podcasts](https://podcasts.google.com/) a try - I have glanced through it in the past, but never used it as a daily driver. After I started using it, one of the things I noticed was the feature to synchronize listening progress across devices. It didn't make sense that Google would skip on something as basic as that - I was scanning through settings to see if it is potentially turned OFF, but didn't see anything related to it.

After little bit of [~~Googling~~](https://www.google.com/) [Bing](https://www.bing.com/)-ing, I realized that cross-device sync is supported only if you have "[Web & App Activity](https://myactivity.google.com/activitycontrols?settings=search&utm_source=help&pli=1)" turned ON on your Google Profile.

Once I got it going, have been having pretty good experience with Google Podcasts, and don't see myself moving over to another app or service any time soon!
